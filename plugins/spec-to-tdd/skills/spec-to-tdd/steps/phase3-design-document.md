# Phase 3 — Solution Design Document

1. Read the critical files identified during Phase 1-2 to verify your understanding before finalizing the design.
2. Save a design document (requirements, investigation summary, implementation strategy, detailed change list, subtask list, precedence diagram) as a Markdown file:
   - Path: `<project-root>/.claude/claudeRes/docs/<YY_MM_DD>_solution_design_<name>.md` (create the directory if it does not exist)
   - Reference existing functions and utilities to reuse, with their file paths.
3. Summarize the design in smart and easy-to-understand manner and display it to terminal
4. Submit the document to the user for review and approval. Incorporate any revisions and confirm the final plan.
